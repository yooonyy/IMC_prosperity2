## Round Summaries

### Common Content for All Rounds <br>
1. A kind of individual turn system. <br>
2. Orders are cancelled at every point in time, so re-processed to next timestamp. <br>
3. Based on AWS, so performance is limited. Need to simplify operations.(At most, linear regression) <br>
4. If server goes down(It happens sometimes), they might give you additional 24hours for given round.

### Tutorial Round
We spend most of our time in tutorial, understanding how the competition was going and how the algorithm worked.
At the end, we made our mind to deal with this round with Market Making and Market Taking by considering limit position.
There were two products that we was going to trade.

 **Amethesis"** <br>
 1. The fair value of amethesis was very clear (10000) <br>
 2. So it was easier than starfruit to Market Making and Taking given its fair value <br>

 **"Starfruit"** <br>
 1. A price of it was not stationary, so we tried its fair value by using rolling linear regression.
 2. Searched various periods to predict its fair value by heatmap and multi plot.

### Round 1: Market Making(MM) <br>
The algo side of round 1 appeared to be a continuation of the tutorial round on new data.
So we re-checked our algorithms logics and focused on reconstructing the code in a more object-oriented way. 

### Round 2: OTC Arbitrage Trading <br>
It was the most incomprehensible round.
The featured product was 'Orchid', which, according to official documentation, is sensitive to variations in sunlight and humidity.
However, the provided data was insufficient as it did not fully align with the descriptions in the document, making it challenging to use climate data as a leading or explanatory indicator for pricing. During the competition, there was significant debate on Discord among participants regarding the utility of climate data in our trading strategies. Ultimately, it was concluded that climate data was unsuitable for strategic purposes in this context. Initially, we attempted a preemptive pricing strategy based on climate data, but this approach was rejected.

Instead, the main strategy shifted to focus on arbitrage in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Unlike Round 1, Round 2 allowed for OTC trades, which introduced more dynamic strategic options due to unexpectedly favorable conditions, such as lower than anticipated import tariffs and subsidies that reduced the impact of export tariffs.
The allowance for OTC trading meant that positions could be cleared more rapidly than in the previous round, making our approach more flexible and responsive. This strategic shift helped us to capitalize on market inefficiencies more effectively and adapt our tactics to the evolving trading environment.

Manual Trading was about triangular arbitrage.

### Round 3: Basket Arbitrage Trading <br>

Round 3 introduced the GIFT_BASKET, akin to an ETF product, accompanied by detailed data on each component's price and weight within the basket. This allowed us to calculate the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the gift basket.

By comparing the calculated NAV with the actual basket price, we determined the premium or discount at which the basket was trading. Utilizing the z-score of this premium, we calculated the expected price shift. This price shift was then added to the current market price to establish the Fair Value of the basket. Armed with this valuation, we employed a Market Making and Taking strategy similar to the previous rounds.

This round was particularly engaging as it mirrored real-world trading scenarios where ETFs do not always align perfectly in price movements with their underlying assets. The strategy not only tested our ability to quickly adapt and calculate under pressure but also allowed us to exploit these inefficiencies for potential gains.

Manual trading was about game theory.

### Round 4:  Call Option Trading (hedging delta and exposing to vega) <br>

Round 4 was domain of call option trading, leveraging financial instruments disguised as "COCONUT" and "COCONUT_COUPON." Our strategy pivoted around a detailed application of the Black-Scholes-Merton model and focused on managing the option's Greeks, particularly delta and vega.

Delta Neutral Strategy: Aimed to maintain a delta-neutral position to hedge against price movements in the underlying asset, thereby primarily exposing our position to changes in volatility (vega).
Implied Volatility Tracking: Used a rolling z-score of implied volatility (IV) to gauge the overbought or oversold states of the options. This metric helped identify mean-reversion opportunities in the options market.
Mean-Reversion Based on IV: If the IV z-score crossed predefined thresholds, we implemented a pyramid-style trading strategy to exploit these IV extremes.
Dynamic Delta Hedging: Adjusted our positions in real-time to neutralize the delta, ensuring that our exposure to price movements was minimized while maintaining our positions to benefit from spikes in volatility.
Technical Implementation
Calculating Implied Volatility: We computed the IV using the BSM formula adapted for zero interest rates. This computation took into account the current market prices of the underlying asset and the option itself.
Z-Score for IV: A rolling calculation of the z-score for IV was implemented to dynamically assess the trading environment and adjust strategies accordingly.
Order Management: Orders were dynamically managed based on the IV's z-score and delta adjustments, allowing us to react promptly to market conditions.
Logging and Adjustments: Throughout the trading period, adjustments were logged meticulously to ensure transparency and enable post-analysis of the strategy's effectiveness.
Challenges and Adjustments
Market Sensitivity: The strategy required constant adjustment to the sensitivity parameters for the IV z-score to optimize the trading responses.
Technical Implementations: Due to the complexity of the calculations, particularly those involving the BSM derivatives and the dynamic hedging components, significant effort was put into ensuring that the computational overhead did not hinder real-time trading responses.

### Round 5: Multi-agent  <br>
- In this round, the information and characteristics of the orderer are provided (i.e. multi-agent round) <br>
- At this time, the use of the concept of "Market Microstructure". <br>
- Traditional economic theory that prices are continuous and found? Wrong <br>
- Prices are discontinuous and formed by market participants <br>

Due to delay of competition, All of us were so busy with our mid-term that we couldn't participate in round 5.
So we just modified some codes in previous round and submitted.

## In Closing
- Among many algorithmic trading competitions, IMC Prosperity stands out due to its engaging storyline and well-designed graphics. Despite its challenges, it was an enjoyable experience throughout.
- The unexpected server downtime extended the competition by 24 hours, causing inconvenience and disrupting schedules for many participants. Nevertheless, I would like to express my gratitude to IMC for hosting such a fascinating event.
- I am deeply thankful to Jiseop for introducing me to this competition and encouraging participation. His initiative allowed us to explore market microstructures, CLOB, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic trading strategies extensively.
- My heartfelt thanks also go to Sanghyun, who did not give up despite the difficulties and took charge of manual trading and documenting our meetings, contributing significantly until the end.
- Despite overlapping with exam periods, the fact that we could conduct our Zoom meetings daily past midnight for over two hours without any complaints speaks volumes about the good team spirit and the enjoyable nature of the competition.
- If Prosperity3 is held, I definitely plan to participate again and hope that more people in Korea will also take interest and join the competition.
